```

### Managing Fixtures and Player Stats

- For fixtures, create or edit a league post and go to 'Fixtures.'
- To enter player stats, go to 'Home Team Players' or 'Away Team Players' within the league post.

## Point Management System

The plugin features a flexible point management system that allows administrators to control how points are distributed to participants in leagues.

### Point Distribution Methods

The system offers three different distribution methods to suit various league formats:

**Tiered Distribution (Based on Participants)**
This method automatically adjusts point distribution based on the number of league participants. The system scales rewards proportionally - larger leagues offer more points to winners, while smaller leagues provide modest but fair rewards.

**Fixed Distribution**
Administrators have complete control over point allocation by manually setting specific point values for each placement:
- First place: Custom point value
- Second place: Custom point value  
- Third place: Custom point value

This method works well for leagues where you want consistent, predictable rewards regardless of participant count.

**Winner Takes All**
In this high-stakes format, the league winner receives points equal to the total number of participants in the league. For example, if 20 players join a league, the winner receives 20 points while other participants receive nothing.

### User Role Permissions

Administrators can customize which user roles have permission to create and manage different aspects of the system:

**Configurable Permissions by Role:**
- Subscribers
- Authors  
- Contributors
- Other WordPress user roles

![Settings Page 1](screenshots/settings1.jpg)
![Settings Page 2](screenshots/settings2.jpg)


**Available Permissions:**
- Create new leagues
- Add players to the system
- Create and manage clubs

This role-based system ensures proper access control while allowing flexibility in how your community participates in league management.

### Point Transfer System

Users can send points to each other, creating opportunities for:
- Rewarding helpful community members
- Creating informal betting or trading systems
- Building social engagement within your leagues

## SuperFantasy Integration

For users who want to get started quickly without the hassle of manually creating players and leagues, the plugin includes integration with SuperFantasy.net.

### Easy League Setup

The plugin currently offers a hardcoded option that allows you to select and import leagues directly from the SuperFantasy API (https://superfantasy.net/). This feature is perfect for:
- Users who don't want to spend time creating extensive player databases
- Quick setup and testing of the plugin functionality
- Access to professionally maintained player data

### Enhanced Workflow with SuperFantasy Pro

SuperFantasy offers a Pro version that significantly streamlines player statistics management. The recommended workflow is:

1. **Create your league on SuperFantasy.net** - Use their Pro tools for easy player stat entry
2. **Import the league into your WordPress site** - Load the complete league data through the plugin
3. **Manage locally** - Run your league on your own WordPress installation with all the custom point rules and user management features

This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds: SuperFantasy's efficient stat management tools combined with your WordPress site's custom point distribution system and community features.

**Benefits of this approach:**
- Simplified player statistics entry through SuperFantasy Pro
- Reduced setup time for new leagues  
- Professional player database maintenance
- Full control over your community and point system on your WordPress site
